/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
*/
// This is a single-line comment.

// Comments are important for the following reasons:
// 1. They help you understand your code.
// 2. They help others understand your code.
// 3. They help you debug your code.
// 4. They help you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the code.

/* Originally this was the unique type of comment */
// Now we have the single-line comment

    printf("Comments!\n"); //This prints "Comments!" to the screen
    return 0;
